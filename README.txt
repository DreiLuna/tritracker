Hello there! Just a couple of things to make sure everything runs smoothly

1. If you somehow receive an error, first let me know, second to continue using the app just resart and type reset in the calories input. 
yes you will lose your progress for the day but TBH thats on u gang

2. If you would like to add presets from someone else you can easy copy and past into the presets.txt file. BUT MAKE SURE THERE IS NO EXTRA LINE/PARAGRAPHING AT THE BOTTOM IT WILL 
MESS YOUR PRESETS UP. If this does happen you can go in and remove it later but you may error out and lose your days progress.

NOTE: you should never lose your history file. That file will track how many calories/fats/proteins you ate ever day you logged them. If it does please lmk how u did it and I will try and fix it asap
